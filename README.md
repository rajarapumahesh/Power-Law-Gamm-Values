**Gamma-Corrected Image Enhancement Model**

Overview:
This Python script implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to enhance images by correcting gamma values. It loads pairs of original and enhanced images, along with their corresponding gamma values, to train the model. The model architecture includes convolutional layers and incorporates gamma values as additional input for image enhancement. After training, the script utilizes the trained model to enhance a specified input image by adjusting its gamma value. The enhanced image is then saved to an output folder.
